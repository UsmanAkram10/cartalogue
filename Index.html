<h1>New Aston Martin DB11 Volante: New pics of convertible DB11</h1>
</head>
	<p>Aston Martin's confirmed new convertible will arrive in spring 2018. We've got fresh pictures of the DB11 Volante in action.

Aston Martin has confirmed it is preparing a convertible version of its new DB11 grand tourer for spring 2018, and after the British marque released a handful of teaser shots for the upcoming DB11 Volante, we’ve now received a flurry of spy shots, revealing the car in greater detail. 
</p>
<p>The DB11 Volante prototype wears some squared off bodywork over the rear wings, but we don’t think this is indicative of a major design difference. The same flowing lines and rear end of the coupe with C-shaped rear lights will be on the Volante, and while the new shots are the first look at the car’s face it’s un-surprising to see no changes here.</p> 

<p>The latest photographs also show the DB11 Volante testing alongside a regular coupe version – a sneak glimpse at how the two new Astons compare to each other in the flesh.</p>
<p>Rather than a folding hard top roof, the DB11 Volante will use a lighter and less complicated soft-top arrangement. Power will come from the same 5.2-litre twin-turbo V12 engine as in the DB11 coupe, producing 600bhp and 700Nm of torque. An eight-speed automatic gearbox will drive power to the rear wheels.</p>

<p>With the extra strengthening needed for a convertible version, the Volante will be heavier than the 1,800kg DB11 coupe, which means the 0-62mph time will increase, up to around 4.3 seconds. A top speed of around 200mph will place it among the fastest convertibles on the road.</p>
<p>Inside, expect the same luxuriously-upholsered interior as the coupe but with a wait until 2018 on the cards, we expect to see a few updates to keep it fresh before it hits the showrooms. The Aston Martin DB11 Volante is likely to command a significant premium over the £154,900 DB11, perhaps costing as much as £175,000.</p>
